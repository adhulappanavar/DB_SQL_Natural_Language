# New Complex Join Examples Summary

## üéØ Overview

Added **20 new complex join examples** to the TicketQueue Natural Language to SQL system, expanding from 25 to 45 total examples. These new examples demonstrate sophisticated multi-table joins, conditional relationships, and advanced query patterns.

## üìä New Examples Added

### 1. Multi-Table Dependency Analysis
- "Show ticket items with their dependencies, assigned users, and ticket queue information"
- "List ticket items with their prerequisites, assigned users, and estimated vs actual hours"
- "Find ticket items that are blocking other tasks with their assigned users and ticket queue details"
- "Find ticket items with multiple dependencies, their assigned users, and ticket queue details"

### 2. Cross-Table User Analysis
- "Find users who have both assigned ticket items and have made comments on other ticket items"
- "Show users with their assigned ticket items, ticket queue information, and completion status"
- "List users with their role, assigned ticket items, and ticket queues they're managing"
- "Show users with their assigned ticket items, ticket queue information, and performance metrics"
- "Find users who have commented on ticket items they're not assigned to"

### 3. Many-to-Many Relationship Queries
- "Show ticket queues with their categories, assigned users, and total ticket items count"
- "Find ticket queues with multiple categories, assigned users, and ticket items by status"
- "Show ticket items with their prerequisites, assigned users, ticket queue, and category information"
- "List ticket queues with their assigned users, ticket items by priority, and completion statistics"

### 4. Aggregation and Counting Queries
- "List ticket items with their dependencies, comments count, and attachment count"
- "Show ticket items with their dependencies, comments from all users, and attachment information"
- "Show ticket items with their dependencies, comments from assigned users, and attachments"
- "List ticket items with their dependencies, comments from assigned users, and attachment details"

### 5. Complex Filtering and Status Analysis
- "Find ticket items that are overdue with their assigned users, ticket queue, and priority level"
- "Find ticket queues with high priority overdue items, their assigned users, and category information"
- "Show ticket queues with their categories, assigned users, and overdue ticket items count"

## üèóÔ∏è Complex Join Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Self-Referencing Joins (Dependencies)
```sql
-- Ticket item dependencies with user and queue info
FROM ticket_item_dependencies wid
JOIN ticket_items dep ON wid.dependent_item_id = dep.id
JOIN ticket_items pre ON wid.prerequisite_item_id = pre.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON dep.assigned_to = u.id
LEFT JOIN ticket_queue wq ON dep.ticket_queue_id = wq.id
```

### 2. Many-to-Many Relationships
```sql
-- Ticket queue categories with aggregation
FROM ticket_queue wq
LEFT JOIN ticket_queue_category_assignment wqca ON wq.id = wqca.ticket_queue_id
LEFT JOIN ticket_queue_categories wqc ON wqca.category_id = wqc.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON wq.assigned_to = u.id
LEFT JOIN ticket_items wi ON wq.id = wi.ticket_queue_id
```

### 3. Conditional Joins
```sql
-- Comments from assigned users only
LEFT JOIN ticket_item_comments wic ON wi.id = wic.ticket_item_id AND wic.user_id = wi.assigned_to
```

### 4. Multi-Table Aggregation
```sql
-- Count across multiple related tables
COUNT(DISTINCT wid.dependent_item_id) as dependencies_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT wic.id) as comments_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT wia.id) as attachments_count
```

### 5. Complex WHERE Conditions
```sql
-- Overdue items with multiple filters
WHERE wi.due_date < datetime('now') 
AND wi.status != 'completed'
AND wi.priority = 1
```

## üéØ Advanced Query Features

### 1. GROUP BY with Multiple Aggregations
```sql
GROUP BY wq.id, wq.title, u.first_name, u.last_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT wqc.id) > 1
```

### 2. CASE Statements for Conditional Logic
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN wi.status = 'completed' THEN 'Completed'
    WHEN wi.actual_hours IS NULL THEN 'Not Started'
    WHEN wi.actual_hours <= wi.estimated_hours THEN 'On Track'
    ELSE 'Over Budget'
END as completion_status
```

### 3. GROUP_CONCAT for Concatenated Results
```sql
GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT wqc.name, ', ') as categories
GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT wi.title, '; ') as ticket_item_titles
```

### 4. Complex ORDER BY Clauses
```sql
ORDER BY wi.priority, wi.due_date ASC
ORDER BY dependencies_count DESC, comments_count DESC
```

## üìà Enhanced Prompt Examples

Added 6 new complex examples to the AI prompt:

1. **Multi-table dependency joins** with user and queue information
